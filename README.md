# WordTree
My Grade 10 English Culminating 

Why you selected this subject and how (with quotes from the novel) does this subject connect to an important message in the text The Book Thief 

I selected the subject of symbolism as I could reflect how Liesel learned from her experiences through my product. Each quote I chose is from a different chapter of The Book Thief which effected Liesel to learn and adapt from those challenges, eventually blossoming into another life. The Book Thief has many messages and meanings throughout its paragraphs, but the result of overcoming challenges is one I wanted to focus on for this project. 

What values or beliefs are evident in your product? Provide evidence. 

My product conveys believing the hope of change. The tree itself is a metaphor of Liesel and the leaves on her tree represent her experiences lead by her strong emotions. By creating an interactive website to understand Liesel’s experiences, it demonstrates how change comes from important moments throughout life. My product also shows the value of time taken to change. After clicking on all the leaves, there is a moment before the tree is replaced by the flower. The pause represents the time and patience needed to change. 
What is the implicit message or theme of your product? How do you accomplish this message? 
The message of my product is how the experiences and challenges a person must confront determines who they become in the future. As you discover the elements of Liesel’s younger life as you pick off the leaves, she eventually turns into a flower because she blossoms from those moments. From using the leaves to represent the quotes, I successfully display the message of my project by showing the development of a person who has lived through challenges. 

What two significant media conventions did you use in your product and why was each one chosen (PPE format)? 

I used the contrast of colours as a media convention to show the difference of between two stages of Liesel’s life. The big vibrant flower compared to the little decomposing leaves and signifies a dramatic change. By using the contrast of colours, the illustrations effectively show how she developed from the past stage. Additionally, I added a coloured dialogue box at the top of the screen to display the text and pixelated drawings. In many RPG games, dialogue boxes are commonly used to display information or speech of characters. Adding gamification elements engages my audience and effectively voices the message. 
What two significant argument techniques did you use in your product and why was each one chosen (PPE format)?
Emotional appeal was used throughout the product to provoke empathy in the audience. One of the quotes says, "Upon her arrival, you could still see the bite marks of snow on her hands and the frosty blood on her fingers"(31). After the quote, I wrote a sentence to make my audience feel sorry for her: “She was so cold and scared. I would be too”. By adding small blurbs to the quotes, I can implant different emotions with my audience, creating an empathetic connection with Liesel. Furthermore, repetition was used to emphasis my message further. A rhetorical question was repeated at the start and end of the website: “What does it take to change?”. By introducing and closing the experience with the same question, there is greater emphasis on the meaning and the reinforces message of my product. 

What did you do to prepare for the project, and what issues did you have with making it? 

Originally, I had the idea of making a physical sculpture of a tree. However, the week after the culminating was assigned, I attended a hackathon and during the hackathon I built my first website through a workshop that was hosted there. The whole experience ignited my passion learn to code. I figured schoolwork was the best way to commit to learning this skill. With the knowledge I gained from the workshop, I was able to apply the basic elements of my idea. I was able to learn some logic and make my website interactive with the help of online tutorials. Of course, not all tutorials were helpful, and I had many problems with coding the buttons. The biggest problem I had is when I hid one button, it would completely mess of the positions of all the buttons if not clicked in a specific order. The script was difficult to figure out since I have no experience with JavaScript or any coding language before this project. What saved me was the previous logic I learned from the computer technologies course. Although I did not learn any coding languages in the course, it taught me the foundational logic that all coding languages share. 

Overall, explain what you would do to improve, and what you did well.

I wanted my website to have more gamification, but the lack of programming knowledge restricted my ability to do so. Also, to fit The Book Thief theme better, I would have added the elements of the pages or added the font with the texts, but I could not figure out how to link the font file into my script. My favourite part of my product is the interactive buttons and creating the drawings. All the buttons work, and the elements are in the correct place. Overall, as my first-time coding a project by myself that works I am proud of the result.
